Please create all pull requests against the 'working' branch. The 'master'
branch is reserved for full releases, complete with updated docs, etc.

While PEP8 is generally followed, it is not treated as Holy Gospel. Practicality
beats purity, and coming up with some convoluted coding to avoid a line of 82
characters is an anti-pattern.

When indenting continuation lines, the standard is 2 levels (i.e., 8 spaces).
Please do not use "visual indentation", as it is fraught with its own
issues with consistency.

All changes other than simple typos should be accompanied by unit tests. All
changes must pass all unit tests. You can run the tests by making sure that
the `nose` module and running:
    nose --with-coverage -w tests/unit/
