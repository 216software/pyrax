## Working with Cloud Servers
Once you are authenticated, you can easily interact with Rackspace Cloud Servers.

### Listing Servers
Let's start by listing all the servers in our account:

	import pyrax
	pyrax.set_credential_file("/path/to/credential/file")
	cs = pyrax.cloudservers
	print cs.servers.list()

If you already have Cloud Servers, you will get back a list of server objects. But let's assume that you've just started with the Rackspace Cloud, and you got back an empty list, which isn't terribly interesting, so creating a new cloud server would be a good first step.

To do that, we'll need to specify the operating system image to use for our new server, as well as the flavor. "Flavor" refers to the combination of RAM and disk size for the new server.

### Listing Images
To get a list of available images, run:

	print cs.images.list()


Here's what I got:

	[<Image: Windows Server 2012 (with updates) + SQL Server 2012 Web>, <Image: Windows Server 2012 (with updates) + SQL Server 2012 Standard>, <Image: Windows Server 2012 + SQL Server 2012 Web>, <Image: Windows Server 2012 + SQL Server 2012 Standard>, <Image: Windows Server 2012 (with updates)>, <Image: CentOS 5.8>, <Image: Arch 2012.08>, <Image: Gentoo 12.3>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 + SharePoint Foundation 2010 SP1 & SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 Std>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 + SharePoint Foundation 2010 SP1 & SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 Express>, <Image: Windows Server 2012>, <Image: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx)>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 + SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (with updates) + SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 Web>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (with updates) + SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 Standard>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (with updates) + SQL Server 2012 Web>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 + SQL Server 2008 R2 Web>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 + SQL Server 2012 Web>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (with updates) + SQL Server 2012 Standard>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 + SQL Server 2012 Standard>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (with updates)>, <Image: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1>, <Image: CentOS 6.3>, <Image: FreeBSD 9>, <Image: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1>, <Image: Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Oncelot)>, <Image: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin)>, <Image: Fedora 17 (Beefy Miracle)>, <Image: CentOS 6.2>, <Image: CentOS 6.0>, <Image: CentOS 5.6>, <Image: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal)>, <Image: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5>, <Image: openSUSE 12.1>, <Image: Fedora 16 (Verne)>, <Image: Debian 6 (Squeeze)>]

Note that this is a list of image *objects*, not just a bunch of name strings. So let's get some more information this time:

	imgs = cs.images.list()
	for img in imgs:
	    print img.name, "  -- ID:", img.id

This is the output:

### Listing Flavors
Let's do the same for flavors:

	flvs = cs.flavors.list()
	for flv in flvs:
	    print "Name:", flv.name
	    print "  ID:", flv.id
	    print "  RAM:", flv.ram
	    print "  Disk:", flv.disk
	    print "  VCPUs:", flv.vcpus
 
This returns:

	Name: 512MB Standard Instance
	  ID: 2
	  RAM: 512
	  Disk: 20
	  VCPUs: 1
	Name: 1GB Standard Instance
	  ID: 3
	  RAM: 1024
	  Disk: 40
	  VCPUs: 1
	Name: 2GB Standard Instance
	  ID: 4
	  RAM: 2048
	  Disk: 80
	  VCPUs: 2
	Name: 4GB Standard Instance
	  ID: 5
	  RAM: 4096
	  Disk: 160
	  VCPUs: 2
	Name: 8GB Standard Instance
	  ID: 6
	  RAM: 8192
	  Disk: 320
	  VCPUs: 4
	Name: 15GB Standard Instance
	  ID: 7
	  RAM: 15360
	  Disk: 620
	  VCPUs: 6
	Name: 30GB Standard Instance
	  ID: 8
	  RAM: 30720
	  Disk: 1200
	  VCPUs: 8

OK, so now we have the available images and flavors. Let's create a **512MB Ubuntu 12.04** server; to do this, we can use the find() method and the exact name of the image. This is difficult, since the exact name is 'Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin)', which you probably wouldn't have guessed. So the easiest way to do this is to check in a less restrictive manner:

	ubu_image = [img for img in cs.images.list()
			if "Ubuntu 12.04" in img.name][0]

We can do something similar to get the 512MB flavor:

	flavor_512 = [flavor for flavor in cs.flavors.list()
			if flavor.ram == 512][0]

Note that these calls are somewhat inefficient, so if you're going to be working with images and flavors a lot, it's best to make the listing call once and store the results locally. Images and flavors typically don't change very often.

### Creating a Server
OK, now that we have the image and flavor objects we want (actually, it's their **id** attributes we really need), we're ready to spin up our new cloud server! To do this, we call the create() method, passing in the name we want to give the new server, along with the IDs for the desired image and flavor.

	server = cs.servers.create("first_server", ubu_image.id, flavor_512.id)

This returns a new server object; you can test it out with:

	print server.id
	=> u'afbabf55-a9b5-4e77-82bd-d57ab69f2992'
	print server.status
	=> u'BUILD'
	print server.adminPass
	=> u'73hgYoBnwoXu'
	print server.networks
	=> {}

Wait - the server has no network addresses? How useful is that? How are you supposed to work with a cloud server that's not on a network?

Relax! If you ran that code, you noticed that it returned almost immediately. What happened is that the cloud API recorded your request, and returned as much information as it could about the server that it was *going to create*. The networking for the server hadn't been created yet, so it couldn't provide that information.

One important bit of information is the __adminPass__ â€“ without that, you won't be able to shell into your server. It is *only* supplied with the server object returned from the initial create() request; after that you can no longer retrieve it. Note: if this does happen, you can call the change_password() method of the server object to set a new root password on the server.

This brings up an important point: the server objects you get back are essentially snapshots of that server at the moment you requested the information. Your object's 'BUILD' status won't change no matter how long you wait; you'll have to refresh it to see any changes. In other words, these objects are not dynamic. Fortunately, refreshing the object is simple enough to do:

	server = cs.servers.get(server.id)

The get(id) method takes the ID of the desired server and returns a Server object with the latest information about that server. Try getting the network addresses again with the newly-fetched object:

	print server.networks
	=> {u'private': [u'10.179.xxx.xxx'], u'public': [u'198.101.xxx.xxx', u'2001:4800:780d:0509:8ca7:b42c:xxxx:xxxx']}

Finally, when you are done with this server, you can easily delete it:

	server.delete()

Note that the server isn't deleted immediately (though it usually does happen pretty quickly). If you try refreshing your server object just after calling delete(), the call will probably succeed. But trying again a few seconds later will result in a `NotFound` exception being raised.


#### Additional parameters to create()
There are several optional parameters that you can include when creating a server. Here are the two most common:

`meta` - This is an arbitrary dict of up to 5 key/value pairs that can be stored with the server. Note that the keys and values must be simple strings, and not numbers, datetimes, tuples, etc.

`files` - A dict of up to 5 files that will be written to the server upon creation. The keys for this dict is the absolute file path on the server where the file will be written, and the values are the contents for those files. Values can either be a string, or a file-like object that will be read. File sizes are limited to 10K; binary files are not supported (i.e., text only).

Let's create a server with those two options; the setup code is the same as in the previous examples; here is the part that we need to change:

	meta = {"test_key": "test_value",
			"meaning_of_life": "42"}
	content = """This is the contents of the text file.
	It has several lines of text.
	
	And it even has a blank line."""
	
	files = {"/root/testfile": content}
	server = cs.servers.create("meta_server", ubuid, flavor_512.id,
			meta=meta, files=files)

Run that code, and then wait for the server to finish building. When it does, use the admin password to ssh into the server, and then do a directory listing of /root. You should see a file named 'testfile'; run `cat testfile` to verify that the content of the file matches what we had in the script.

Disconnect from the server, and then use the server's ID to get a server object. Check its 'metadata' attribute to verify that it contains the same key/value pairs we specified.

----

### Deleting all servers
Since each server object has a delete() method, it's simple to delete all the servers that you've created:

	for server in cs.servers.list():
		server.delete()
